    "## EDA summary\n",
    "1. **users:**\n",
    "    - **uid**:According to basis stats, distribution and cdf, 25% of users has CTR above 0.2. This is way larger than 0.03. Therefore I define for users, CTR above 0.2 is hige CTR. In next step anlaysises, I'll compare feature distriubtion of high CTR group and low CTR group to find out any significat different.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **age**: people who didn't report their age tend to have higher CTR. **This might be a good new feature.** Although the age distributions of two CTR groups are slightly different from each other, they distribute approximatly even across age 4 to age 7. Not really helpful for creating new feature.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **city**:didn't analyze this because too many unique cities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - **city_rank**: users from level 2 city have higher CTR.**a good new feature.**\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - **residence**: province 11 and 22 have high CTR.**a good new feature.**\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **career**: there is no significant hight ctr nor diffent distribution. Won't be a good indicator if treating it as a single feature. Will see if this can help in clustering.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **gender**: gender 3 has higher CTR.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **up_life_duration**: Although 1 to 10 have higher CTR, compare with distribution plots, these groups don't account to much data in the total dataset. But what is interesting is that high ctr group has more -1 and low ctr group has more 20. **a good new feature.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **up_membership_grade**: there is no significant hight ctr nor diffent distribution. Won't be a good indicator if treating it as a single feature. Won't be a good indicator in clustering since distributions are similar.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **membership_life_duration**: This is too imbalance. Almost every users belong to -1 group. This makes CTR analysis unreliable because one click in groups other than -1 ca make a huge impact on CTR. This is not a good indicator even in clustering.\n",
    "    - **consume_purchase**: won't be using it. same reason as membership_life_duration\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **communication_avgonline_30d**: most users stay active 10 ~ 13 hrs daily. But non-registered users have higher CTR. **a good indicator**\n",
