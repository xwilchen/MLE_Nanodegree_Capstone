# Data
The data is downloaded form
<br>[2020 DIGIX Advertisement CTR Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/louischen7/2020-digix-advertisement-ctr-prediction) 
on Kaggle created by Louis_Chen7 

I will use only **train.csv** 
since there is no label in **test.csv**
<br>The data is about 6.1 GB so I won't include whole dataset in repo.
<br>I will use only a subset of data to work on capstone project

There is a [data dictionary](/data%20dictionary.odt) in this repo to see what information is in this data.
